# Electrical testing and verification

Initially a visual evaluation will be carried out prior to a more detailed examination utilizing ETCI (Electro-Technical Council of Ireland) approved electrical test equipment finishes the process. Following the examination, your electrician will supply a detailed inspection report highlighting any concerns found and actions to correct these problems.

A regular examination makes sure a safe work environment for all workers and is an important part of the Health & Safety program for any service. In fact, the ‘Safety, Health And Welfare At Work’ Statutory Regulation 89(b) of SI 299 2007 as amended by SI 732 2007 states that all companies are obliged to hold a legitimate Periodic Inspection Report.
